# Time as Computation Cost (TACC)

I was folding my kid's laundry ‚Äî a rare moment of quiet.
That time and space (pun intended) let my mind wander, and a thought hit me:

**If time dilation is the same effect in both Special and General Relativity ‚Äî just driven by different inputs (velocity vs. gravity) ‚Äî how can we honestly treat time as fundamental, and SR and GR as disconnected theories?**

Both lead to the same measurable outcome: the slowing of proper time relative to another frame.
Yet physics still frames them as separate conceptual worlds ‚Äî SR for motion in flat spacetime, GR for curvature in the presence of mass and energy.
This split persists mostly because they emerged from different historical problems, use different mathematical formalisms, and lack an agreed-upon common substrate.
Without such a substrate model, the matching outputs are treated as coincidence rather than consequence.
Here, I propose the coincidence is no coincidence ‚Äî they are the same process, seen through different input channels.

## Theory in Brief

This project explores **time as computational cost**. The core idea:

- Each observer experiences time as a sequence of **Planck-scale "ticks"**‚Äîthe finest possible resolution step.
- Entities that demand **more computational work to resolve** (due to high velocity or deep gravitational potential) require **more Planck ticks per "frame"** of resolved reality.
- If more ticks are consumed per frame, **fewer frames are experienced per unit of global evolution**, which manifests as **time dilation** for that entity from an external observer's perspective.
- Locally, nothing "feels slower": the observer's own tick rate feels normal. What changes is the **mapping** between local ticks and external events.

Formally in this repo's notation, the **computational capacity** \(N\) and the **constitutive relation** \(B(N)\) govern how spacetime intervals are resolved. Increased computational load ‚Üí effectively reduced capacity for "new frames" per unit external evolution ‚Üí observed time dilation.

> **Intuition:** Think of a fixed global budget of Planck ticks. If an entity's physics becomes computationally expensive, more ticks are spent per frame there, so that entity produces fewer frames in the same external progression. External clocks see it run slow.

For details, see: [docs/model_in_brief.md](docs/model_in_brief.md) and the quick visual notebook: [notebooks/01_Time_Dilation_Ticks.ipynb](notebooks/01_Time_Dilation_Ticks.ipynb).

## Theoretical Framework (Conceptual)

This project explores whether **computational capacity constraints could provide an alternative foundation for spacetime geometry**. The core hypothesis: **time dilation might emerge from fundamental limitations in computational capacity**.

**Physical Substrate - Waveform States:**
The underlying mechanism operates through two distinct states of waveforms across the causal mesh:

- **Smear**: Waveforms distributed across the causal mesh, representing the velocity-based form of time dilation in Special Relativity. High-velocity entities require increased computational resources to track their distributed quantum states across multiple causal nodes.

- **Concentration**: Waveforms highly localized in spacetime, representing the gravity-based form of time dilation in General Relativity. Strong gravitational fields compress waveform information into smaller regions, demanding intensive computational resolution of the concentrated states.

Both smear and concentration alter the complexity and resolution requirements of the underlying waveform substrate. Despite originating from divergent initial conditions (velocity versus gravitational fields), both states increase the computational load required to resolve the entity's quantum state, leading to the same observable outcome: **time dilation**.

**Mathematical Framework:**
- Spacetime metric: `ds¬≤ = -N¬≤c¬≤dt¬≤ + [1/B(N)]dx¬≤`
- Constitutive law: `B(N) = exp[-Œ∫(1-N)]` *(chosen for mathematical convenience)*
- Computational capacity `N` *(physical interpretation to be determined)*
- Parameter `Œ∫` controls deviations from General Relativity
- When `Œ∫ = 2`, the model exactly recovers Einstein's GR *(by design)*

## What This Repository Actually Is: A Research Laboratory

**This is not a complete physics theory. This is a computational research platform.**

We built this repository as a **laboratory for exploring computational approaches to spacetime geometry**. The core insight that motivated this work was simple: if both Special and General Relativity produce the same observable outcome (time dilation) through different input mechanisms (velocity vs. gravity), perhaps there's a deeper substrate they both emerge from.

**Why We Needed This Lab:**

1. **Missing Infrastructure**: There wasn't a clean, parameterized framework for testing computational approaches to gravity. Most work in this area is either purely theoretical or uses custom, non-reproducible code.

2. **Systematic Testing**: To explore whether computational constraints could underlie spacetime geometry, we needed a platform that could:
   - Test different constitutive laws B(N) as theories develop
   - Validate against known physics as a sanity check
   - Extract parameters from data (real or synthetic) 
   - Generate predictions across multiple physical scales

3. **Collaborative Development**: The questions this work addresses‚Äîconnections between computation, information, and spacetime‚Äîrequire input from diverse fields. We needed an accessible platform where physicists, computer scientists, and mathematicians could contribute.

4. **Educational Value**: Whether or not the core hypothesis proves correct, the framework serves as an excellent platform for teaching metric theories, parameter estimation, and model comparison techniques.

**What the Lab Enables:**
- Rapid testing of different physical interpretations for "computational capacity N"
- Easy swapping of constitutive laws B(N) as theory develops
- Parameter extraction and uncertainty quantification
- Multi-scale validation from quantum to cosmological physics
- Reproducible experiments that others can build upon

**What We're NOT Claiming:**
- That this is established physics (it isn't)
- That we've solved quantum gravity (we haven't)
- That our current B(N) functional form is correct (it's a placeholder)
- That computational capacity N has a specific physical meaning (to be determined)

**The Goal:** Provide the computational infrastructure needed to systematically explore whether computational constraints could provide a foundation for understanding spacetime geometry. The lab is ready; now we need the physics to fill it.

## üîç **Current Limitations & Open Questions**

**Scientific Honesty:** This framework currently has significant gaps that need addressing:

### Fundamental Issues Requiring Resolution
- **No microscopic derivation**: Why B(N) = exp[-Œ∫(1-N)] specifically? Need theoretical justification
- **Undefined core concept**: What is "computational capacity N" physically? How is it measured?
- **Parameter tuning**: Œ∫=2 chosen to match GR, not derived from principles
- **Limited scope**: Only tested against known solar system results

### Mathematical/Implementation Gaps  
- **Synthetic data**: "Bandgaps experiments" use generated data, not real measurements
- **Missing physics**: No connection to thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, or information theory
- **Circular validation**: Reproduces GR by design, doesn't make novel predictions

### Development History (Transparency)
- **Bug fixes**: Major calculation error (5 orders of magnitude) recently corrected
- **Rapid development**: 5-day concept-to-framework timeline indicates preliminary status
- **Ongoing refinement**: Multiple debugging files show active development

## Physical Motivation & Vision

**The Big Question:** Could spacetime geometry emerge from computational constraints rather than mass-energy?

**Core Hypothesis:** Time dilation might reflect fundamental limitations in the computational capacity available for physical processes.

**Why This Might Matter:**
- Information-theoretic foundations for gravity
- Alternative perspective on spacetime emergence  
- Potential connections to quantum computation and thermodynamics
- New experimental approaches to testing spacetime structure

**Current Status:** Mathematical framework established, physical foundation needs development.
