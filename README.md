# Time as Computation Cost[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/robbybrodie/time_as_computation_cost/blob/main/capacity-physics/experiments.ipynb)


Welcome! This project explores a big idea: what if we could understand the universe by thinking about time as a kind of "cost" for doing things, like a price you pay for making changes or moving stuff around.

## What is this about?

Imagine you want to move something, change its shape, or make it do something new. In the real world, these things take time and energy. This project looks at the rules and patterns behind how much "cost" (in time) it takes to make changes in physical systems. It's a way to look at physics from a new angleâ€”by asking, "How much does it 'cost' to make something happen?"

## Who is this for?

- Curious people who want to see physics in a new light
- Researchers interested in the connection between time, energy, and information
- Anyone who likes thinking about how the universe works, without needing to know advanced math

## What's inside?

- **capacity-physics/**: The main code and tools for exploring these ideas
- **experiments.ipynb** (in capacity-physics/): A ready-to-run notebook for experiments in Google Colab
- **configs/**: Example settings for running experiments
- **data/**: Example data and results
- **reports/**: Space for summaries and findings

## How do I get started?

You don't need to be a physicist or a programmer to get something out of this project. Start by reading the explanations and looking at the examples. If you're comfortable with code, you can dive into the `capacity-physics` folder to see how the ideas are explored in practice.

### Run Experiments in Google Colab

You can run experiments from this project directly in your browser using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/):

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click "File" > "Upload notebook" and select `capacity-physics/experiments.ipynb` from this repository.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up and run experiments.

This project is set up to work with an MCP server that helps automate Colab integration as part of the workflow. As the project evolves, more features may be added to streamline running and sharing experiments in Colab.

## Why does this matter?

By thinking about time as a kind of "cost," we might find new ways to understand everything from the tiniest particles to the biggest galaxies. It's a fresh perspective that could lead to new discoveries.
