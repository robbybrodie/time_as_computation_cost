# Time as Computation Cost

Welcome! This project explores a big idea: what if we could understand the universe by thinking about time as a kind of "cost" for doing things, like a price you pay for making changes or moving stuff around.

## What is this about?

Imagine you want to move something, change its shape, or make it do something new. In the real world, these things take time and energy. This project looks at the rules and patterns behind how much "cost" (in time) it takes to make changes in physical systems. It's a way to look at physics from a new angleâ€”by asking, "How much does it 'cost' to make something happen?"

## Who is this for?

- Curious people who want to see physics in a new light
- Researchers interested in the connection between time, energy, and information
- Anyone who likes thinking about how the universe works, without needing to know advanced math

## What's inside?

- **capacity-physics/**: The main code and tools for exploring these ideas
- **configs/**: Example settings for running experiments
- **data/**: Example data and results
- **reports/**: Space for summaries and findings

## How do I get started?

You don't need to be a physicist or a programmer to get something out of this project. Start by reading the explanations and looking at the examples. If you're comfortable with code, you can dive into the `capacity-physics` folder to see how the ideas are explored in practice.

## Why does this matter?

By thinking about time as a kind of "cost," we might find new ways to understand everything from the tiniest particles to the biggest galaxies. It's a fresh perspective that could lead to new discoveries.
