TACC Gravitational Wave Propagation Results
==========================================

Parameter Estimation Results:
  Best-fit κ = 2.000002
  χ² = 1961458.450
  Fit successful: True
  Binary masses: 36.0 + 29.0 M☉
  Distance: 410 Mpc

Multi-messenger Constraints (GW170817-like):
  GW-EM time difference: 1.74 s
  Distance: 130 Mpc
  Speed constraint: |v_gw/c - 1| < 3×10⁻¹⁵

TACC Dispersion Relations:
  v_gw = c√B(N_background)
  Time delay: Δt = d(1/v_gw - 1/c)
  For κ=2: v_gw = c exactly (GR recovery)
  For κ≠2: v_gw ≠ c (observable deviation)

Physical Interpretation:
- κ controls gravitational wave generation and propagation
- Orbital dynamics modified by computational capacity
- Wave speed depends on background computational capacity
- Multi-messenger astronomy provides tight constraints
- Binary inspirals probe strong-field regime of TACC

Key Insights:
- GW generation scales with B(N) at orbital separation
- Phase evolution modified by computational constraints
- Dispersion relation: ω² = k²c²B(N)
- LIGO/Virgo detection provides κ constraints
- Future space-based detectors (LISA) will improve constraints
