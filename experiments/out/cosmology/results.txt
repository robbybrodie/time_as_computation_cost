TACC Cosmological Expansion Results
===================================

Best-fit parameters from synthetic supernova data:
  κ = 2.138279
  H₀ = 70.536 km/s/Mpc
  Ωₘ = 0.285339
  Ωᵈᵉ = 0.714661
  χ² = 81.903
  χ²/dof = 0.844
  Degrees of freedom = 97
  Fit successful: True

Physical Interpretation:
- κ controls how computational capacity affects cosmic expansion
- κ = 2.0 recovers standard ΛCDM cosmology
- κ ≠ 2.0 predicts deviations in distance-redshift relation
- TACC provides natural dark energy through computational constraints

Key Insights:
- Scale factor a(t) is interpreted as computational capacity N
- B(N) = exp[-κ(1-N)] modifies Friedmann equation
- Early universe (small a) had reduced computational capacity
- Present acceleration emerges from capacity constraints
